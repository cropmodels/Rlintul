** physical soil characteristics 

** volumetric soil moisture contents 
SMDRY    =   0.150  !  soil moisture content at airdry (pF= 6.0) [cm3/cm3]
SMW      =   0.200  !  soil moisture content at wilting point (pF= 4.2) [cm3/cm3]
SMFC     =   0.350  !  soil moisture content at field capacity (pF= 2.3) [cm3/cm3]
SM0      =   0.450  !  soil moisture content at saturation [cm3/cm3]
CRAIRC   =   0.07   !  critical soil air content for aeration [cm3/cm3]
   
** intial soil moisture contents
SMI      =   0.300  !  soil moisture content in initial root zone at planting or emergence [cm3/cm3]
SMLOWI   =   0.300  !  initial soil moisture content in lower zone at planting or emergence [cm3/cm3] 

* maximum effective rooting depth
RDMSO    =  150.  !  maximum rooting depth as determined by soil structure [cm]

* surface runoff fraction
RUNFR    =   0.0 ! average fraction of precipitation lost by runoff [-]

* correction factor of time course of soil evaporation (value between 1 and about 4)
CFEV    =   2.0

* percolation to deeper soil layers
KSUB    =   10.   ! maximal percolation rate from lower zone to deeper soil layers [cm day-1]
